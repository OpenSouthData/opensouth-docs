## Data Validation

1. **Purpose:**

   - Ensure that the data uploaded to the platform is accurate, complete, and reliable.

2. **Validation Procedures:**

   - **Schema Validation:** Verify that the data conforms to the predefined schema, including field types, required fields, and data formats.
   - **Range Checks:** Ensure that numerical data falls within expected ranges.
   - **Consistency Checks:** Check for logical consistency within the data, such as matching totals or coherent dates.
   - **Uniqueness Checks:** Verify that unique fields, such as IDs, do not contain duplicate values.
   - **Referential Integrity:** Ensure that relationships between different datasets are consistent and valid.

3. **Automated Tools:**

   - Utilize automated validation tools to quickly assess the accuracy and integrity of the data.
   - Set up automated alerts for any detected validation errors.

## Data Cleaning Tools

1. **Purpose:**

   - Prepare the data for analysis by removing errors, inconsistencies, and irrelevant information.

2. **Available Tools:**

   - **OpenRefine:** A powerful tool for cleaning messy data, transforming it from one format into another, and extending it with web services.
   - **Trifacta:** A data wrangling tool that helps in cleaning and transforming data through an intuitive interface.
   - **Pandas (Python Library):** Provides data structures and functions needed to clean and manipulate data effectively.
   - **Talend Data Preparation:** An intuitive tool for cleaning, enriching, and sharing data.

3. **Cleaning Procedures:**

   - **Removing Duplicates:** Identify and remove duplicate records.
   - **Handling Missing Values:** Fill in missing values or exclude incomplete records as necessary.
   - **Standardizing Formats:** Ensure that all data follows a consistent format, such as date formats or capitalization.
   - **Correcting Errors:** Detects and corrects errors in the data, such as typos or mislabeling.

## Quality Metrics

1. **Purpose:**

   - Assess the overall quality of the data to ensure it meets the required standards for analysis and decision-making.

2. **Metrics:**

   - **Accuracy:** Measure the degree to which data correctly describes the real-world object or event.
   - **Completeness:** Assess whether all required data is present and accounted for.
   - **Consistency:** Ensure that data is consistent across different datasets and throughout time.
   - **Timeliness:** Evaluate if the data is up-to-date and relevant for the current analysis.
   - **Validity:** Check if the data complies with the required format, type, and range constraints.
   - **Uniqueness:** Measure the degree to which all distinct records are unique and free of duplicates.
   - **Integrity:** Ensure that all data is correct and reliable, with strong referential integrity between datasets.

3. **Implementing Quality Checks:**

   - Regularly perform quality assessments using these metrics.
   - Generate reports to identify areas of improvement.
   - Implement corrective actions based on the findings to enhance data quality continuously.
